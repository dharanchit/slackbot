# Slackbot (Hackathon)

During a recent hackathon, our team of three members collaborated to create an innovative Slackbot. This bot utilizes a state-of-the-art language model (LLM) and is powered by Flask. Its primary function is to automate various Jira tasks, streamlining project management processes. By intelligently assigning tasks to the required team members, our Slackbot enhances efficiency and collaboration within the team. With its seamless integration and intelligent automation capabilities, our project represents a significant step forward in optimizing workflow management during hackathons and beyond.
